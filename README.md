### <h2>Helloüôè

#### Two APIs
* StrainAPI - strains, flavors, effects
* Otreeba - strains, lineages

### The Project
I decided to explore the race, flavors, effects of marijuana strains based on their lineage. I pulled this data from two APIs. 1970 strains from StrainAPI and over 9000 strains from Otreeba. There happened to be an overlap of 772 strains that had full data.

Using Dash, Plotly and Flask for the front end and SQLAlchemy for creating the ORM, I put together a dashboard to visualize the data from these 772 strains.
